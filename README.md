# Obstacle-avoidance-of-autonomous-drone-using-ultrasonic-sensor-and-Arm-cortex-M4
This repository includes the detailed code and demonstration of project of speed control of autonomous drone. I have used Arm cortex M4 board.

Program for this task is written in embedded C programming using register level programming.

Please use ARM Cortex M4 board only to run this code. For other M series boards please read the datasheet and design manual of respective Cortex board and set the bit in correspondding registers.
